## GenAI Usage

This project used GenAI tools for brainstorming, creative asset generation, and code reviews.

- **Model Used:** Claude (Opus) — September 2025 version
- **Prompts Used:**

  1. _"Recreate in Studio Ghibli style as a person sitting on an old computer with 'Hello' written on the screen."_ — used to generate concept art inspiration for the hero section theme.
  2. _"Review my index.html and main.css for semantic structure, accessibility issues, and best practices."_ — used to identify improvements and ensure the page passed W3C validation.

- **Validation:** All outputs were manually reviewed, iterated, and integrated into the project only after confirming they followed semantic HTML5, accessibility, and ESLint/Prettier standards.

## Copyrights & Attributions

This project contains a mix of original work, AI-generated assets, and third-party resources.

- **index.html & project.html:**  
  Fully hand-coded by me, following semantic HTML5 and responsive design best practices.
