      <h2>Hero Section Images</h2>
      <div class="credit-item">
        <strong>Background & Character Art</strong>
        <p>
          All hero section images were generated using AI technology. The main
          character illustration was created by providing my personal photograph
          to an AI image generator with the following prompt: "Recreate in
          Studio Ghibli style as a person sitting on an old computer with
          'Hello' written on the screen."
        </p>
        <p>
          The artistic background and layered elements were similarly
          AI-generated to create a cohesive, animated aesthetic.
